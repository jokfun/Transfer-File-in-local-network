# Transfer File in local network

Transfer files over a local network in command line. 

## How to use it

Sending and receiving files is done by the same file that you can launch with the command :
```
python cmdFileTransfer.py
```
After that you have the choice to send or receive files.

### Receive a file

1. Enter the ip and port of the remote machine (information is displayed when the file is launched)
2. If the connection is accepted, enter the requested password on the remote machine.
3. If the password is accepted, enter the path of the file you want to copy.
4. If the transfer works, you will be redirected to the main menu.

### Send a file

You will create a server that will wait for a request, the password will be displayed in the console and if no error message appears you will be redirected to the main menu at the end of the process.

## Why use it

The main purpose of this application is to speed up the file transfer and no longer have to go through external storages during the file transfer.
Updates are coming soon.
